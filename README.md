### Usage

1. **Import Transactions**: Select your bank CSV file on the Transactions page
2. **Create Rules**: Navigate to Categories to create rules for automatic categorization
3. **Analyze**: View your categorized transactions and spending analytics

## Creating Categorization Rules

Rules let you automatically categorize transactions based on criteria:

1. Go to the **Categories** page
2. Select an uncategorized transaction
3. Define matching criteria (merchant name, amount range, etc.)
4. Assign a category (Food, Transportation, Housing, etc.)
5. Save the rule to apply it to all matching transactions

## Supported Bank Formats

The application automatically detects and imports CSV files from various banks:

- **Standard Format 3** (Recommended)
- **Standard Format 1**
- **Standard Format 2**
- **DKB**
- **Sparkasse**
- **Consors Bank**
- **Commerzbank**
- **ING**
- **Comdirect**
- **Mint**
- **Wespac**

### Common Limitations
- Most formats don't provide actual account balance information, so running balances are calculated starting from 0
- BIC codes are frequently missing across formats
- Some formats have missing participant names or IBAN information

If your bank isn't supported, you can use the "Notify Developer" option when uploading files to request format support. This sends anonymized sample data to help implement your format faster.
